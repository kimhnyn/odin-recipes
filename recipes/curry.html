    <h1>Japanese Chicken Curry</h1>
    <img src="../curry.jpeg" alt="Japanese Curry Image">

    <p>
      Japanese Curry, also known as <strong>Curry Rice</strong> is a popular 
      comfort food and home-cooked dish in Japan. With a thicker, stew-like 
      consistency, this curry differs from its Thai, Indian, and Vietnamese
      relatives. It is typically thickened and flavored by a roux sold in grocery stores.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the bite-sized chunks of 
      chicken, thick-cut vegetables, luscious sauce, and fluffy rice, this 
      recipe is something to enjoy not only on busy nights, but also the day after,
      due to its nature of tasting even better on the second day.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>0.25 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 carrots</li>
      <li>2 onions</li>
      <li>3 Yukon gold potatoes</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>0.5 apple</li>
      <li>1.5 tablespoons neutral-flavored oil</li>
      <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
      <li>1 package Japanese curry roux</li>
      <li>2-4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all the ingredients. Please read my blog post on the 
        “secret ingredient” we add to the curry. For this recipe, 
        I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of 
        the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges.
        If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions 
        so they disintegrate into the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel the carrots and cut them into rolling wedges
         (it's called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut 
         creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb
          more flavor and cook faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel the potatoes. Cut each potato into quarters (6 pieces for
         russet potatoes). Soak them in water for 15 minutes to 
         remove excess starch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grate the ginger (I use this grater). You will need 1 tsp of
         grated ginger, including the juice. Mince the garlic and set aside 
         (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grate the apple. My apple today is a lunchbox apple (smaller than 
        regular), so I used the entire apple (yielded ½ cup or 120 ml grated apple).
         If your apple is regular size, use ½-¾ apple.
      </li>
      <li>Cut off the extra fat from the chicken and discard it. Then cut the 
        chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally 
        (it's called sogigiri in Japanese) to create more surface area and
         flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent 
        and tender, about 5 minutes. Don't stir the onions too often because 
        they won’t develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor, 
        so we do not want to skip this step. If you have an extra 5 minutes,
         definitely caramelize the onions!
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic (I pass it through a garlic press for a finer 
        texture) and grated ginger and mix well together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it's no longer pink
         on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to
          medium low temporarily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken stock. Alternatively, you can use water only or use half stock 
        and half water if you're using store-bought curry roux, as it can be too salty. 
        If you're using my homemade curry roux, you don't need to worry as it
         does not contain salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the grated apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup (or any condiment 
        you choose to add). Please read my blog post for details.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the carrots and potatoes. The broth should barely cover the ingredients.
         Don't worry; we don't want too much liquid here, and additional liquid
          will be released from the meat and vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer, <strong>covered*</strong>, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
        *Simmer <strong>uncovered</strong> if the ingredients are 
        completely submerged in the broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to skim the scum and foam 
        from the surface of the broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through 
        the carrots and potatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat. Put 1-2 cubes of roux in a ladleful of cooking 
        liquid, slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks, and stir into 
        the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. 
        With my homemade curry roux, I typically use 6-7 cubes while with store-bought
         curry roux, use 1 full-sized box, which is typically for 8-12 servings 
         (be careful, as some brands offer a smaller box, which is 4 servings).
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry 
        becomes thick, about 5-10 minutes. If your curry is too thick, you can 
        add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no roux or 
        food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you used homemade curry roux (that doesn't include any salt),
         taste the curry and add salt to your taste. Tip: The amount of salt
          will vary based on the brand of the chicken broth and condiments 
          you added, so you must taste the curry yourself and decide 
          how much salt is needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. 
        If you like, garnish with fukujinzuke.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can keep the leftovers in a glass airtight container (so no stains!) 
        and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer 
        for a month. The texture of the potatoes will change in the freezer,
         so you should take them out before freezing. When you reheat, 
         add ¼-½ cup (60-120 ml) water to dilute the curry sauce.
