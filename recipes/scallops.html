      Seared scallops are so simple to make, yet they look and taste 
      like they taste and came from a fancy restaurant! This recipe will
      explain step by step how to prepare fresh scallops.

    <p>
      Through a combination of thoroughly drying the scallops and properly
      heating the oil, any chef can develop a beautiful golden brown 
      crust on each scallop.
